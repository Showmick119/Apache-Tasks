# Apache VizFold
- The first task, assigned to me by the Research Scientists at the Apache Software Foundation. Completing this as one of my summer experiences for delving more into AI/ML research, as well as Open Source Programming

### Summary Of Accomplishments
- Conducted literature review on the protein folding problem, which the AlphaFold2 model solves using database searching algorithms, as well as an Evoformer architecture
- Ran inference on the AlphaFold2 model for 5 proteins: 6KWC, 1UBQ, 2OMF, 1G1J, 1STM
- Noted down the predicted 3D structure of these 5 proteins, as well as the scores from evaluation metrics like TM-score, PAE, pLDDT
- Plotted t-SNE and UMAP values from the parameters outputted by the model in `/t-SNE_plots` and `/UMAP_plots`
